`lvmisc` is a package with miscellaneous R functions, including basic data computation/manipulation, easy plotting and tools for working with statistical models objects. You can learn more about the methods for working with models in `vignette("working_with_models")`.

## Installation

You can install the released version of lvmisc from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lvmisc")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("verasls/lvmisc")
```

## Getting started

Some of what you can do with lvmisc.

```{r example, message = FALSE}
library(lvmisc)
library(dplyr)

# Compute body mass index (BMI) and categorize it
starwars %>%
  select(name, birth_year, mass, height) %>%
  mutate(
    BMI = bmi(mass, height / 100),
    BMI_category = bmi_cat(BMI)
  )

# Divide numerical variables in quantiles
divide_by_quantile(mtcars$wt, 4)

# Center and scale variables by group
center_variable(iris$Petal.Width, by = iris$Species, scale = TRUE)

# Quick and easy plotting with {ggplot}
plot_scatter(mtcars, disp, mpg, color = factor(cyl))

# Work with statistical model objects
m <- lm(disp ~ mpg + hp + cyl + mpg:cyl, mtcars)
accuracy(m)
plot_model(m)
```
